Charm is an open-source modular AI operating system that enables developers to compose, deploy, and scale AI applications across models, tools, frameworks, and SaaS platforms — all through a single unified API and plugin-based architecture, without worrying about low-level execution orchestration or integration complexity.

## Key Feature Design

**Built-in Routing, Fallback & Management.**
Automatically selects and adapts the most suitable model and execution backend based on defined preferences. With built-in fallback strategies, token quota controls, and compute resource management, it ensures reliability at scale — no orchestration logic or infrastructure setup required

**Orchestration & Lifecycle Control.**
Easily orchestrate multi-step workflows across multiple agents with built-in support for execution state tracking, error recovery, and task handoffs. From task routing and planning to execution and final output, the entire process is fully observable — allowing you to build robust and traceable automation systems without managing coordination logic yourself.

**Semantic Abstraction & Format Alignment.**
Seamless communication and collaboration across agents, tools, and platforms — powering cross-ecosystem workflows and SaaS integrations without manual parsing or format transformation.

**Modular, Plugin-Based Architecture.**

- **Protocol Compatibility & Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability.**  
Seamlessly connect pipelines, logic, and output schemas from existing frameworks — no rewrites required, easily extend your current stack with Charm.

- **Composable Runtime & Selective Integration.**  
Flexibly plug external modules, tools, or agent frameworks into any stage of your workflow — allowing hybrid execution flows that combine Charm’s runtime with third-party capabilities.
