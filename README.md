# Welcome to Charm

Charm is an open-source federated middleware designed to stay neutral, enabling your agent definitions to run seamlessly on different runtimes with synchronized states and resumable task flows.

It empowers developers to compose, deploy, and scale AI applications that integrate models, tools, frameworks, and platforms — all through a single unified API and a plugin-based architecture.
