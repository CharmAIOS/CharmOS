Charm is a modular AI OS. With a single unified API and plugin-based architecture, developers can compose, deploy, and scale AI applications across models, tools, frameworks, and SaaS platforms.

## Why Charm?

Use Charm for:

**Built-in Routing, Fallback & Execution.**
Automatically selects the most suitable model and execution backend based on user-defined preferences. Built-in support for fallback strategies, token quota control, and execution state tracking ensures reliability at scale — no orchestration logic or infrastructure setup required.

**Orchestration & Lifecycle Control.**
Easily orchestrate multi-step AI workflows across multiple agents with built-in support for execution state tracking, error recovery, and seamless task handoffs. From task routing and planning to execution and final output, the entire process is fully observable — allowing you to build robust and traceable automation systems without managing coordination logic yourself.

**Semantic Abstraction & Format Alignment.**
Enables agents to communicate using a shared semantic schema, making it easy to pass structured outputs between agents and convert them into compatible formats for seamless integration with Saas platforms — all without manual transformation or custom logic.

**Modular Integration with External Frameworks.**

- **Protocol Compatibility.**  
  Seamlessly integrate pipelines, agents, and output schemas from existing frameworks — Ensure compatibility across ecosystems, so you can onboard legacy workflows, third-party agents, or external runtimes into a unified execution flow.

- **Composable Runtime.**  
  Easily plug in external tools, modules, or agent frameworks at any stage of the execution pipeline — Allows you to experiment, extend, and compose with the best of today’s open ecosystem without rewriting existing logic or workflows.
