# Welcome to Charm

Charm is an open-source modular AI operating system that enables developers to compose, deploy, and scale AI applications across models, tools, frameworks, and SaaS platforms — all through a single unified API and plugin-based architecture.

## Core feature modules

**Execution & Model Routing**:
Intelligently selects and adapts the optimal model and compute backend based on routing policies, with built-in support for fallback strategies, token quota enforcement, and dynamic resource allocation.
**Orchestrator & Lifecycle Manager**:
Orchestrates multi-agent workflows with complete task lifecycle control—including planning, execution, error recovery, and inter-agent handoff—with full traceability and execution observability.
**Semantic Middleware & Format Adapter**:
Standardizes and transforms diverse inputs, outputs, and protocols into structured semantic formats, enabling seamless routing, validation, and cross-platform compatibility.
**Integration & Event Bridge**:
Facilitates bidirectional communication with external platforms via APIs, webhooks, or event polling—supporting asynchronous triggers, state-based reactivation, and real-time task continuation.


## Architecture
- **Protocol Compatibility & Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability.**  
Seamlessly connect pipelines, logic, and output schemas from existing frameworks — no rewrites required, easily extend your current stack with Charm.

- **Composable Runtime & Selective Integration.**  
Flexibly plug external modules, tools, or agent frameworks into any stage of your workflow — allowing hybrid execution flows that combine Charm’s runtime with third-party capabilities.
