# CrewAI → LangGraph Use Case: Research Agent

> This is a conceptual use case to illustrate the portability flow.
> Code examples and runnable fixtures will be added in later releases.

## Overview

This use case demonstrates how a research-type agent originally built with CrewAI can leverage its collaborative reasoning and task-delegation capabilities, and be extended through LangGraph into an agent system with structured orchestration, persistence, and workflow control.

Through agent mapping and bridging, Charm abstracts away the boundaries between environments and frameworks, allowing developers to establish an executable cross-framework agent pipeline between CrewAI and LangGraph, while maintaining the agent’s context and synchronized state.
