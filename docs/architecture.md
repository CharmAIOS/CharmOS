### External Output Adapter
Analyzes and converts outputs from external agents or frameworks into compatible internal formats for continued execution within the system.
### Smart Orchestrator Layer
Handles all internal coordination required to interpret requests, plan execution, and manage task flows across the system.
#### Unified API Access
Transforms incoming requests into internal task objects to initiate routing and execution within the system.
#### Routing Criteria Parser
Parses incoming tasks and applies routing logic based on user-defined strategies, system defaults and real-time context.
- **Request Analyzer**: Extracts routing-relevant parameters from task payloads and user context.
- **Policy Matcher**: Evaluates extracted parameters against strategy rules and condition logic to determine routing eligibility.
#### Routing Engine  
Selects the optimal model and execution path by scoring available options against extracted parameters and routing strategies.
- **Scoring Engine**: Computes weighted scores for candidate models or environments based on defined routing criteria.  
- **Preference Evaluator**: Adjusts scores or rankings based on user-defined or system-defined priorities.  
- **Eligibility Filter**: Removes models or options that fail to meet critical constraints.
#### Routing & Planning Orchestrator  
Builds and coordinates executable task flows based on selected routing paths, enabling structured multi-step execution across models and environments.
- **Workflow Planner**: Defines the logical structure of a task and determines the appropriate execution sequence for each stage.
- **Task Graph Builder**: Converts the plan into a structured dependency graph, enabling parallelism and conditional branching where needed.  
- **Execution Trigger & Sync**: Initiates each task node based on graph logic and manages synchronization points across sequential or concurrent steps.
#### AI Service Adapter
Standardizes and unifies model invocation logic across different AI providers
#### Task Lifecycle Orchestrator  
Manages task execution states, context continuity, fault tolerance, and coordination across execution cycles.
- **Task State Manager**: Tracks task status transitions.
- **Task Context Manager**: Maintains contextual bindings across tasks, sessions, and agents to enable continuity in multi-turn interactions and agent-to-agent workflows.  
- **Fallback / Retry Manager**: Handles task failures and timeouts by switching models, invoking alternative endpoints, or resuming interrupted executions.  
- **IPC / Inter-App Control Layer**: Facilitates internal communication and control signals between agents, enabling synchronized multi-turn execution and inter-module orchestration.
### Inference Execution Layer
Executes model inference tasks by selecting appropriate runtime environments and handling low-level invocation across web, local, or cloud backends.
#### Runtime Executor  
Orchestrates the execution of inference tasks by invoking environment adapters and coordinating model-specific runtime components.
#### Inference Environment Adapter  
Translates routing decisions into executable configurations tailored to the selected inference backend.
#### Runtime Executor  
Initiates and monitors inference tasks based on routing decisions, invoking appropriate runtime environments and reporting execution status back to the orchestrator.
#### Inference Management
Translates routing outputs into concrete execution configurations
- **Environment Binding**: Establishes and configures the appropriate runtime environment based on routing instructions.
- **Service Invocation Adapter**: Adapts invocation logic to the specific AI provider’s interface while maintaining a unified execution contract.
- **Model Execution Router**: Selects the most suitable deployed model version or variant within the target environment to fulfill the task requirements.
#### Execution Runtime  
Executes the finalized inference package in the selected environment, ensuring the model runs correctly and returns results to the orchestrator layer.
- **Web Inference Engine**: Runs models in the browser environment for real-time, client-side execution.
- **Local Inference Engine**: Executes models on local hardware, typically used for offline, high-privacy, or low-latency tasks.
- **Cloud Inference Adapter**: Connects to external cloud-based inference APIs and handles request/response logic.
### Resource Governance Layer
Intelligently manages system runtime execution resources, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
#### Inference Task Queue Manager
Schedules and prioritizes inference tasks based on urgency, model cost-efficiency, and overall system load.
#### Compute Strategy Selector
Determines the optimal execution environment based on device capabilities, latency requirements, and hybrid inference policies.
- **Environment Readiness Checker**: Validates compute environment availability and readiness.
- **Execution Policy Evaluator**: Aligns execution strategies with routing policies and real-time hardware status.
#### LLM Token Quota Controller
Monitors and enforces token usage limits in accordance with predefined budgets.

### Format & Semantic Abstraction Layer
Handles transformation of raw AI outputs into structured, semantically meaningful formats that can be reused, interpreted, or converted across workflows and ecosystem.
#### AI Output Normalization Layer
Extracts and transforms unstructured AI outputs into structured internal representations.
- **Output Format Identifier**: Detects the format or layout pattern of model outputs.
- **Structured Block Parser**: Segments content into logical blocks (e.g. paragraphs, tables, lists) for processing.
- **Semantic Data Extractor**: Identifies and isolates key-value pairs, intents, or key facts from output blocks.
- **Converter to Internal Structured Output Schema**: Maps parsed content into the system's unified internal structure for downstream processing.

#### AI Output Format Adapter
Interfaces model outputs from various providers or versions with the normalization layer, standardizing metadata, delimiters, or layout quirks.

#### Structured Format Layer
Maintains a registry of supported structured output schemas (e.g. table schema, task schema, UI component schema) and ensures compatibility across tasks.

#### Format Conversion Layer
Handles output-to-output transformations between different formats required by downstream modules or external tools.
- **Conversion Logic, Annotation Rules, Templates**: Encodes transformation rules, markup logic, or templates for structured output.
- **Multi-format Input Support**: Accepts different format sources (e.g. JSON, YAML, Markdown, natural language) for conversion.
- **Developer Extensibility**: Provides hooks or plugin APIs to define custom format transformers or new templates.

#### Semantic Abstraction Layer
Aligns structured outputs to universal semantic units for composability, validation, and cross-model compatibility.
- **Standard Semantic Unit Definitions**: Defines the system-wide building blocks (e.g. TaskDefinition, ChartBlock, ReportSegment).
- **Semantic Mapping Specifications**: Specifies how structured outputs map into semantic units.
- **Format Bridge**: Translates between format-centric and semantic-centric representations as needed.

#### Market Format Conversion Layer
Provides adapters to convert internal semantic outputs into third-party compatible formats (e.g. Notion block format, Figma node spec, Google Slides JSON schema), enabling cross-platform publishing or embedding.
