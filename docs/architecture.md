### External Output Adapter
Analyzes and converts outputs from external applications or frameworks into compatible internal formats for continued execution within the system.

### Smart Orchestrator Layer
Handles all internal coordination required to interpret requests, plan execution, and manage task flows across the system.
#### Routing Criteria Parser
Parses incoming tasks and applies routing logic based on user-defined strategies, system defaults and real-time context.
- **Request Analyzer**: Extracts routing-relevant parameters from task payloads and user context.
- **Policy Matcher**: Evaluates extracted parameters against strategy rules and conditional logic to determine routing eligibility.
#### Routing Engine  
Selects the optimal model and execution path by scoring available options against extracted parameters and routing strategies.
- **Scoring Engine**: Computes weighted scores for candidate models or environments based on defined routing criteria.
- **Preference Evaluator**: Modifies scores or rankings according to user-defined or system-level priorities.
- **Eligibility Filter**: Excludes models or options that fail to meet critical constraints.
#### Routing & Planning Orchestrator  
Constructs and coordinates executable task flows based on selected routing paths, enabling structured multi-step execution across models and environments.
- **Workflow Planner**: Defines the logical structure of each task and determines the optimal execution sequence for every stage.
- **Task Graph Builder**: Translates the plan into a structured dependency graph, supporting parallelism and conditional branching as needed.
- **Execution Trigger & Sync**: Initiates task nodes according to the graph logic and manages synchronization across sequential and concurrent steps.
#### Task Lifecycle Orchestrator 
Oversees task execution states, ensures context continuity, and manages fault tolerance across execution cycles.
- **Task State Manager**: Monitors and transitions task states throughout the lifecycle.
- **Task Context Manager**: Maintains contextual bindings across tasks, sessions, and runtime environments to preserve continuity in multi-turn interactions and cross-application workflows.
- **Fallback / Retry Manager**: Handles execution failures or timeouts by switching models, triggering alternative endpoints, or resuming interrupted processes.
- **IPC / Inter-App Control Layer**: Manages internal signaling and communication between components.

### Inference Execution Layer
Executes model inference tasks by selecting optimal runtime environments and managing invocation across web, local, or cloud backends.
#### Runtime Executor  
Initiates and monitors inference tasks based on routing outputs, invoking the designated runtime and relaying execution status to the orchestrator.
#### Inference Management
Handles strategic binding between tasks and compute resources. Determines where, what, and how to execute inference based on routing directives.
- **Environment Binding**: Selects the most suitable runtime environment (local, cloud, browser) based on task needs.
- **Service Invocation Adapter**: Maps execution logic to the specific AI provider’s interface while preserving a unified invocation contract.
- **Model Selector**: Identifies and selects the optimal deployed model version or variant within the target environment to meet task requirements.
#### Inference Environment Adapter  
Bridges routing decisions with backend execution environments by translating execution plans into runtime-specific configurations.
- **Execution Config Translator**: Transforms routing directives into concrete parameters tailored to the selected inference backend.
- **Runtime Environment Initializer**: Validates environment readiness and initializes configuration settings required to execute inference tasks across local, cloud, or in-browser contexts.
#### Inference Runtime  
Executes the finalized inference package within the selected environment, ensuring correct model operation and returning results to the orchestrator layer.
- **Web Inference Engine**: Executes models directly in the browser for real-time, client-side inference.
- **Local Inference Engine**: Runs models on local hardware, ideal for offline execution, high privacy, or low-latency requirements.
- **Cloud Inference Adapter**: Interfaces with cloud-based inference APIs, managing request submission and response handling.

### Resource Management Layer
Intelligently manages runtime execution resources across the system.
#### Inference Task Queue Manager
Schedules and prioritizes inference tasks based on execution context factors.
#### Compute Strategy Selector
Determines the optimal execution environment based on execution context and deployment constraints
- **Environment Readiness Checker**: Validates the availability and readiness of target compute environments.
- **Execution Policy Evaluator**: Aligns execution strategies with routing policies and real-time hardware status.
#### LLM Token Quota Controller
Monitors and enforces token usage limits based on predefined budgets and quota policies.

### Format & Semantic Abstraction Layer
Handles the transformation of raw AI outputs into structured, semantically meaningful formats that can be interpreted, reused, or converted across workflows and ecosystem integrations.
#### Output Normalization Module
Extracts and transforms unstructured AI outputs into standardized internal representations.
- **Output Format Identifier**: Detects and classifies structural patterns in model outputs to guide downstream parsing strategies.
- **Structured Block Parser**: Identifies and isolates logical blocks within the output format.
- **Semantic Data Extractor**: Bridges format and intent by extracting semantic elements from parsed blocks.
- **Internal Structured Output Schema Converter**: Converts extracted data into the system’s unified internal schema for consistent downstream processing.
#### Format Conversion Engine
Transforms normalized internal outputs into target formats based on task objectives and developer-defined export preferences.
- **Format Transformation Engine**: Applies conversion logic informed by routing hints and system templates to convert structured outputs into designated format types.
- **Input Structure Parser**: Detects and adapts various structured block types to ensure compatibility with conversion workflows.
- **Output Template Renderer**: Generates the final output using built-in or custom developer templates tailored for specific downstream platforms.
#### Semantic Abstraction Unit
Defines and governs standardized semantic units and ensures consistent interpretation and mapping across internal schemas and external integrations.
- **Semantic Unit Registry**: Maintains a library of reusable semantic units for consistent generation and interpretation.
- **Semantic Mapper**: Bi-directionally maps semantic units to task-specific structures and external format specifications.
- **Bridge Adapter**: Bridges internal semantic representations into formats compatible with external tools
#### Market Format Adapter
Prepares and delivers structured outputs as platform-specific payloads optimized for external tool integration.
- **Compatibility Validator**: Verifies alignment between structured outputs and the format constraints of target platforms.
- **Adaptive Format Refinement Engine**: Dynamically refines converted formats to meet the specific requirements of the delivery destination.
- **Delivery Packaging Unit**: Assembles final payloads for API-based export, iframe embedding, or plugin-based platform integration

### External IPC & API Adapter Layer
Enables dynamic API exposure and real-time interoperability across AI applications and SaaS platforms via standardized bidirectional interfaces.
#### Bi-directional API Adapter
