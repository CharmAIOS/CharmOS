### Fixtures

We use small, static sample agents to validate each step of the [pipeline](https://github.com/CharmAIOS/Charm/blob/main/docs/pipeline.md):

- Raw agent definitions
- Normalized UAC Objects

Contributors can use these fixtures to test Parsers, renderers, and loaders for the CrewAI → LangGraph route.
