Here are the basic concepts about Charm middleware version. Help you know more about what we're doing right now!

### Agent Portability
Enables agents to be portable between ecosystems by:
- Parsing agent definitions and configuration from various sources
- Converting them into a neutral, standardized format
- Mapping and registering them within target frameworks

This allows your agents to be built, extended, and executed on multiple runtimes — without rewriting logic or losing semantic context.

### Execution Bridge
Maintains a shared runtime channel that carries state, memory, and correlation metadata,allowing you to:
- compose continuous agent flows
- pause, resume, or migrate tasks

seamlessly across frameworks and sessions.

### Agent in sync
Keeps your agent’s state, context, and definition synchronized across all connected frameworks.
Any updates made in one runtime are automatically reflected in others, ensuring the agent maintains a single, continuous identity throughout its environments.
