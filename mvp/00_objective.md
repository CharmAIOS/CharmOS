## 00 · Objective: MVP Goal & Strategic Positioning

### MVP Goal
Enable CharmOS to receive and process outputs from external agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, Dify), completing the agent execution pipeline — transforming agent results into structured formats, routing them through post-processing logic, and delivering the final output to external tools.

### Why start here?
CharmOS uses a plugin-based, modular design to ensure compatibility and seamless collaboration with external frameworks and tools.

This MVP shows how CharmOS fills critical gaps — enabling smoother workflows and proving we’re here to build with, not against, the existing ecosystem.

### Transition roadmap: Demo ➝ MVP ➝ Full Product
- **Demo**: Mock end-to-end flow from task input ➝ model output ➝ semantic conversion ➝ output delivery.
- **MVP**: Implement real semantic abstraction and external output delivery for agent results.
- **Full Product**: Expand to handle multi-agent workflows, dynamic plugins, user-level routing rules, and multi-modal execution orchestration.
