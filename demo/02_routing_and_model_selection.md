## 02 Â· Routing & Model Selection

### This module demonstrates
Simulates how CharmOS selects an appropriate model and execution environment based on user-defined preferences like latency, privacy, and provider.

### Implementation reference
- Use a mocked `Routing Engine` that accepts inputs such as `latency_mode`, `preferred_model`, or `privacy_level`.
- Simulate a decision-making process and return a hardcoded routing result
- No actual model inference is triggered; this module only illustrates how routing logic interprets input parameters and selects a model path.
- Display the routing result in console or markdown.

> Note: This module assumes the task config has already been validated and parsed by the unified interface.
