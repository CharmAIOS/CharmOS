## 04 · Interoperability: Semantic Handoff

### This module demonstrates
How standardized semantic_blocks enable seamless handoff and collaboration between native and external agents.

### Implementation reference
- Prepare two sets of `semantic_blocks`:  
  - One generated natively (Module 03)  
  - One adapted from an external framework (e.g., a simulated LangChain output JSON → converted into semantic_blocks)
- Log both versions to confirm their structure and alignment.
- Inject `semantic_blocks`A as input into a follow-up task, simulating handoff from Agent A to Agent B
- Output logs confirming receipt and reuse of prior semantic content

### MVP Relevance
- Semantic block compatibility across both native and external agent outputs
- Define an interoperable input mechanism for passing semantic blocks across agents
