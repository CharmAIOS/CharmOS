## 04 · Interoperability: Semantic Handoff

### This module demonstrates
How standardized semantic_blocks enable seamless handoff and collaboration between native and external agents.

### Implementation reference
- Prepare two sets of `semantic_blocks`:  
  - One generated from native output (Module 03)
  - One adapted from an external framework (e.g., simulated LangChain output → normalized into semantic_blocks)
- Both versions follow the same internal schema to demonstrate structural alignment.
- Simulate passing `semantic_blocks`A as input to a follow-up task (Handoff from Agent A to Agent B)
- This module focuses on demonstrating compatibility and reuse logic across agents, not rendering output.

### MVP Relevance
- Semantic block compatibility across both native and external agent outputs
- Define an interoperable input mechanism for passing semantic blocks across agents
