## 05 Â· Output Handler: Format & Delivery

### This module demonstrates
Converts internal semantic blocks into external-facing formats and simulates dispatch to designated platforms.

### Implementation reference
- Use mock `semantic_blocks` from previous modules as input.
- Convert them into multiple target formats:
  - Markdown list  
  - JSON payload for API  
  - Simulated Notion block structure  
- Simulated dispatch behavior will be demonstrated in Module 06.
- No real API call is made; the focus is to demonstrate format transformation and how the output could be delivered.

### MVP Relevance
- Define format adapters for common destinations (e.g., Notion, Slack, Markdown).
- Provide mock interfaces for dispatch, which can be upgraded into real webhooks or API in the MVP.
- Introduce basic context management logic:
  - **Context Continuity**: Maintains session state and binding across sequential outputs.
  - **Turn Synchronization**: Controls execution timing based on external platform responses or handoff needs.
