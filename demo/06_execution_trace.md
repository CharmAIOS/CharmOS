## 06 Â· Execution Trace: Step-by-Step Flow Logging

### This module demonstrates
How each stage of the CharmOS task execution flow is logged.

### Implementation reference
- Use hardcoded logs that simulate each execution phase:
  - Task received via API or CLI
  - Routing decision made
  - Model "called" and responded
  - Output normalized to semantic blocks
  - Formatted result generated
  - Dispatched to mock external platform
- Display these steps line-by-line in console or markdown with clear labels.
- Focus on illustrating how modular components operate in sequence.

### MVP Relevance
Lays the groundwork for real-time debugging, transparency, and developer observability in the MVP.
- Standardize trace logging structure for each module.
- Ensure each module emits metadata-rich execution logs.
- Supports the development of diagnostic tools or dashboards in future iterations.
