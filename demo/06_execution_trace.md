## 06 Â· Execution Trace: Step-by-Step Flow Logging

### This module demonstrates
Simulates how each stage of the CharmOS task execution flow is logged, allowing trace operations through the modular pipeline.

### Implementation reference
- Use hardcoded logs that simulate each execution phase:
  - Task received via API or CLI
  - Routing decision made
  - Model "called" and responded
  - Output normalized to semantic blocks
  - Formatted result generated
  - Dispatched to external platform
- Display these steps line-by-line in console or markdown with clear labels.
- Focus on illustrating how modular components operate in sequence.

### MVP Relevance
- Standardize trace logging structure for each module.
